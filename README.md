Hi, in this repository i focused on Customer Segmentation.
At the beginning i tried to divided customers to some groups manually using plots but the output was not disappointing. 
Then i scaled my data using StandardScaler and using K-mean i divided my dataset to 6 clusters. 
The conclusion was definitely better than in manual exaple. 

If you have any question or suggestion please do not hesiatate to contact me :)
